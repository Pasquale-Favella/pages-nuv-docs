It separates the inventory in multiple folders under `inventory` and the starting point in multiple under the `scripts` folder, so you can build either a server or a cloud with it.\n\nThe script is expected to be configured with:\n\n```\n./config.py <name> <cluster> <params...>\n```\n\nSo edit the `config.py` to generate the inventory for `<name>` under a subfolder of `inventory`\n\nThe script is expected to be executed with `play.sh <name>`\n\nAt the end the script is expected to leave a kubeconfig to access the cluster under `kubeconfig/<name>/kubeconfig`.\n\nSo please implement your deployment as one or more roles under `roles` and create a starting point under `<scripts>` named `<cluster>.yml` that will invoke your role.\n\n\n","slug":"nuvolaris-testing","markdown":"DEVEL"},"__N_SSG":true}
