You can use other IDEs if you want but for VSCode there is the configuration ready. Note that you need also Docker running.\n\nYou can put it at work with the following procedure\n\n1. clone everyting and open it in VSCode:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/nuvolaris/nuvolaris --recurse-submodules\ncode nuvolaris\n```\nIt will open and show a pop-up asking if you want to `Reopen in Container`. Click on it. \n2. When it has finished, open the `workspace.code-workspace` file and then open the workspace (there will be a button to do that, click on it).\n3. Open the Metals plugin (click on the icon that looks like an 'm').\nTo import the project, click on `New Scala Project` (but do not create any project actually) then `import build`. This will activate the Metals plugin, it will import all the subprojects and make available all the features of the plugin.\n4. Check `Run doctor` to verify the projects has been imported correctly. An healthy import looks like this:\n![](./healthy-import.png)\n\n","slug":"nuvolaris-controller","markdown":"README"},"__N_SSG":true}
